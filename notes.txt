	* One Big Project with subproblems
	* New Year Resolution (Goals)
	* Time
	* Survey - Used to help pioritze tasks that user create later on based on category such as health, academics, social, spiritual, career, etc.
	* Memo - for non tasks, for user to quickly jot down.

* Side Project:
	* We will have an assistant to encourage the user to do well or on time with his/her quests. The assistant's name is going to be "Meiyou." Overtime, Meiyou wil 
	give comments to the user depending on: number of success tasks completed, number of failed tasks, time played, etc. The user can also talk to Meiyou for fun.
	Having a conversation with Meiyou does not need to be implemented like an A.I. converstation.
	Depending on the relationship between the user and Meiyou, the user will have speififc normal and secret endings:
	* Normal endings:
		Good: Level 100 - Acheivement - "You earned a medal that certifies you are able (insert inspiration statment here)." Meiyou will say, "I guess you donn't need
			me to keep nagging you anymore, huh?"
		Bad: Level 0 (for at least one month) - The game will delete the saved file, and tells the user to move on and get a new life. "Winners are not afraid of losing, but
			losers are."
	* Secret ending:
		Meiyou will talk to the user about reality and virtuality: what it means to have a purpose, an objective - compared to being aimless, like a stray cat on a
			street in the middle of the night. Meiyou compares the user as an objective seeker, whereas she compares herself as the stray cat. She wonders if the user
			lives a honest life, or if the user told her lies about completing tasks. 
			* If lies, she'll ask what is the purpose of a planner that have goals that can't
			be acheived truthfully. She tells the user that if she has a (life-time) goal, it would be to help the user achieve his biggest goals, as many as possible.
			But for the user to be dishonest to her, Meiyou disappears, and the user will never be able to get her back during or after the game (the user can reinstall
			the game planner to get her back.) 
			* If on the other hand, the user tells truthfully, then Meiyou will tell the user that she is glad about that. She'll
			tell her goal, and that she feels helping the user is an endless satisfying joruney to help the user achieve almost everything. 

		* Note: Before the secret ending, Meiyou would give slices of life regarding sucess, failure, anxiety, depression, and passion, (and maybe more).
	* Feel free to add implmentations for interactions with Meiyou

	* If Meiyou feels left out by the user not using the game planner often, eventually, she'll leave a good-bye note to the user and disappears forever.
